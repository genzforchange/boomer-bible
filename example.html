                <ul> After the Planned Parenthood South Atlantic launched a lawsuit against the states’ six week abortion ban triggered by the US Supreme Courts’ Dobbs decision, and a 13th Circuit judge deferred the case, McMaster joined the defense of the bill. </ul>
            
                <ul> His 6 week abortion ban was not able to be implemented prior to the fall of Roe, and this case was determining its implementability. </ul>
            
                <ul> When asked why, he said “That&#39;s an important case and it&#39;s going to end up in the Supreme Court. The trial judge agreed that that&#39;s where it should be,&#34; McMaster said. &#34;It&#39;s an important case.&#34; </ul>
